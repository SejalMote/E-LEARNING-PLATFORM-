DESCRIPTION:The E-Learning Platform UI is a responsive, multi-page front-end interface designed to enhance online education experiences. It is crafted with modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, while leveraging the Bootstrap 5 framework for a clean, mobile-first, and aesthetically appealing layout. This platform simulates the user interface of an actual e-learning system with features like course listing, video embedding, and progress tracking.

The project includes four core pages:

A Home Page that welcomes users with a visually engaging banner.

A Courses Page that lists available modules with images and links.

A Course Detail Page featuring embedded educational videos and a progress bar.

A Progress Page showing learner progress for each course using visual indicators.
